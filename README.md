# ML4Virginia-Project
A semester long Machine Learning project applying neural networks to real world problems in the state of Virginia. 

Categoriezed Virginia counties into 7 distinct categories based on poison death rate per 100k people
(2-5.9, 6-9.9, 10-13.9, ..., 22-25.9, 26+) deaths per 100k people

Used demographics, school enrollment data, drug use data, medicare enrollment data, and labor force data to predict poisoning deaths

Determined correct category with 80% accuracy and .80 f1 score.
